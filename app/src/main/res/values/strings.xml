        It\'s time for Animaniacs\n
        And we\'re zany to the max\n
        So just sit back and relax\n
        You\'ll laugh \'til you collapse\n
        We\'re Animaniacs!\n\n

        Come join the Warner Brothers\n
        And the Warner Sister, Dot\n
        Just for fun we run around the Warner movie lot.\n
        They lock us in the tower whenever we get caught\n
        But we break loose and then vamoose\n
        And now you know the plot!\n\n

        We\'re Animaniacs!\n
        Dot is cute and Yakko yaks.\n

        Wakko packs away the snacks\n
        While Bill Clinton plays the sax.\n
        (or We\'ve got wisecracks by the stacks.)\n
        (or We pay tons of income tax.)\n
        We\'re Animaniacs!\n
        Meet Pinky and the Brain who want to rule the universe.\n
        (or Meet Ralph and Dr Scratchansniff; say hi to Hello Nurse.)\n
        Goodfeathers flock together; Slappy whacks \'em with her purse.\n
        Buttons chases Mindy, while Rita sings a verse.\n
        The writers flipped; we have no script\n
        Why bother to rehearse?\n\n

        Cast : We\'re Animaniacs!\n
        We have pay-or-play contracts.\n
        We\'re zany to the max\n
        There\'s baloney in our slacks.\n\n

        We\'re Animanie,\n
        Totally insaney\n\n

        Just sit right back and you\'ll hear a tale,\n
        A tale of a fateful trip\n
        That started from this tropic port\n
        Aboard this tiny ship.\n\n

        The mate was a mighty sailing man,\n
        The skipper brave and sure.\n
        Five passengers set sail that day\n
        For a three hour tour, a three hour tour.\n\n

        The weather started getting rough,\n
        The tiny ship was tossed,\n
        If not for the courage of the fearless crew\n
        The Minnow would be lost, the Minnow would be lost.\n\n

        The ship set ground on the shore of this uncharted desert isle\n
        With Gilligan\n
        The Skipper too,\n
        The millionaire and his wife,\n
        The movie star\n
        The Professor and Mary Ann,*\n
        Here on Gilligan\'s Isle.\n\n

    <string name="text_1_body">The end of the Civil War was near When quite accidentally, \n\n
        A hero who sneezed abruptly seized Retreat and reversed it to victory. \n\n
        His medal of honor pleased and thrilled his proud little family group. \n\n
        While pinning it on some blood was spilled And so it was planned he\'d command F Troop. \n\n
        Where Indian fights are colorful sights and nobody takes a lickin\' \n\n
        Where pale face and redskin Both turn chicken. \n\n
        When drilling and fighting get them down, They know their morale can\'t droop. \n\n
        As long as they all relax in town Before they resume with a bang and a boom F Troop. \n\n
